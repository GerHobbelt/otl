<h1>
<a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>
This document describes the Oracle, ODBC and DB2-CLI Template Library,
Version 4.0 (OTL 4.0). OTL 4.0 is a C++ library based on C++ templates.<br>
<p>OTL 4.0 was designed as a combination of a C++ template framework
and
OTL-adapters. The framework is a generic implementation of the concept
of <a href="otl3_str.htm">OTL streams</a>. The OTL-adapters are thin
wrappers
around the database APIs and are used as <i>class type</i> parameters
to
be passed into the template framework.
</p>
<p>OTL 4.0 covers the functionality of a full featured C++ database
access library with just a
handful of classes: <a href="otl3_str.htm">otl_stream</a>, <a
 href="otl3_connect_class.htm">otl_connect</a>,
<a href="otl3_exception_class.htm">otl_exception</a>,
<a href="otl3_long_string.htm">otl_long_string</a>,
and several template PL/SQL (Oracle) <a href="otl3_pl_tab.htm">table
container</a> classes, generated
from the template framework and the OTL-adapters.
</p>
<p>The OTL code gets expanded into direct database API function calls,
so it provides very decent performance (only 10-15% overhead, compared
with the database APIs themselves) and reliability in
multi-processor
environments as well as traditional batch programs. OTL 4.0, being a
template
library, is highly portable since it is self-sufficient and compact
enough.
</p>
<p>OTL 4.0 is ANSI C++ compliant (ANSI C++ typecasts, clean templatized
code, etc.), tightly integrated with the Standard Template Library
(STL)
via STL-compliant <a href="otl3_iterators.htm">stream
iterators</a>,
and natively supports the STL <i>std::string</i>'s in <a
 href="otl3_str.htm">otl_stream</a>'s. OTL integrates with <a
 href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/%7Eschmidt/ACE.html">ACE</a>, and
supports <a
 href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/Doxygen/Current/html/ace/classACE__String__Base.html">ACE_TString</a>s.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>OTL 4.0 supports all versions of Oracle starting with 7.3 (natively
via the corresponding version of the OCI), DB2 UDB LUW / zOS (natively
via DB2 CLI), MS SQL Server 2005/2008 (natively via SNAC), Informix 11
(natively via Informix CLI), TimesTen 7 and higher (natively TimesTen
CLI), SAP-MAX/DB (natively via SAP/DB CLI), ODBC 3.x as well as
ODBC
2.5 (for legacy applications) compliant data sources in MS Windows,
Linux/Unix/Mac OS X (via unixodbc and iODBC driver managers): Sybase,
MySQL, PostgreSQL, EnterpriseDB,
SQLite,&nbsp; MS ACCESS, Firebird, etc.
The list of supported
database back ends is growing.<br>
<br>
In the last few years, transition from the 32-bit platforms to the
64-bit platforms has occurred: OTL's source code is portable, and it
supports both 32-bit and 64-bit C++ compilers. Also, OTL supports UTF-8
and UTF-16 for Oracle, and UTF-16 for the rest of the database
types, when the underlying database API / ODBC driver supports it.<br>
