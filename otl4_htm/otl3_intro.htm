    <h1> <a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>
    This document describes the Oracle, ODBC and DB2-CLI Template
    Library, Version 4.0 (OTL 4.0). OTL 4.0 is a C++ library based on
    C++ templates.<br>
    <p>OTL 4.0 was designed as a combination of a C++ template framework
      and OTL-adapters. The framework is a generic implementation of the
      concept of <a href="otl3_str.htm">OTL streams</a>. The
      OTL-adapters are thin wrappers around the database APIs and are
      used as <i>class type</i> parameters to be passed into the
      template framework. </p>
    <p>OTL 4.0 covers the functionality of a full featured C++ database
      access library with just a handful of classes: <a
        href="otl3_str.htm">otl_stream</a>, <a
        href="otl3_connect_class.htm">otl_connect</a>, <a
        href="otl3_exception_class.htm">otl_exception</a>, <a
        href="otl3_long_string.htm">otl_long_string</a>, and several
      template PL/SQL (Oracle) <a href="otl3_pl_tab.htm">table
        container</a> classes, generated from the template framework and
      the OTL-adapters. </p>
    <p>The OTL code gets expanded into direct database API function
      calls, so it provides very decent performance (only 10-15%
      overhead compared with the database APIs themselves) and
      reliability in multiprocessor environments as well as traditional
      batch programs. OTL 4.0, being a template library, is highly
      portable since it is self-sufficient and compact enough. </p>
    <p>OTL 4.0 is ANSI C++ compliant (ANSI C++ typecasts, clean
      templatized code, etc.), tightly integrated with the Standard
      Template Library (STL) via STL-compliant <a
        href="otl3_iterators.htm">stream iterators</a>, and natively
      supports the STL <i>std::string</i> by the <a
        href="otl3_str.htm">otl_stream</a> class. OTL integrates with <a
        href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/%7Eschmidt/ACE.html">ACE</a>, and
      supports <a
href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/Doxygen/Stable/libace-doc/a00644.html">ACE_TString</a>s.










      A new C++ standard (<a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11">C++11</a>) was
      adopted in 2011. OTL uses C++-11 features like move constructors,
      move assignment operators, nullptr, etc. in order to keep its code
      clean and modern for compilers that support C++11 features.</p>
    <p>OTL 4.0 supports all major and a few minor relational database
      types (Oracle, MS SQL Server, DB2, Informix, TimesTen, MAX/DB,
      etc.) natively via the corresponding database API. For the rest of
      database types (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Sybase, SQLite, MS ACCESS,
      Firebird, etc.), OTL has support via ODBC 3.x, or ODBC 2.5 (legacy
      applications).<br>
    </p>
    <p>In the last several years, transition from 32-bit platforms to
      64-bit platforms has occurred: OTL's source code is portable, and
      it supports both 32-bit and 64-bit C++ compilers. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Also, OTL supports UTF-8 and UTF-16 string data for Oracle, and
      for the rest of the database types, when the underlying database
      API / ODBC driver has the corresponding support.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In 2011, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11">C++11</a>
      standard was adopted. OTL started using C++11 features as soon as
      they became available in major C++ compilers (Visual C++, GNU C++,
      CLANG, etc.) in order to keep OTL as a general-purpose library
      relevant and modern over time.<br>
