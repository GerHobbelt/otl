    <h1>OTL 4.0, OTL stream pooling</h1>
    <p>OTL stream pooling is a mechanism which allows to turn
      inefficiently managed otl_stream's into something of a greater
      value as far as performance is concerned. Instances of otl_stream
      variables get saved in a stream pool, when they get closed, for
      further reuse in the program. Typically, the program may have a
      handful of otl_stream variables, defined locally in functions. The
      streams get instantiated and closed all over again, especially
      when functions get called repeatedly. </p>
    <p>Each instantiation of a stream triggers re-parsing of the
      stream's SQL statement on the database back end. It is a
      relatively expensive operation. The stream pooling mechanism
      alleviates that burden and simplifies coding techniques. </p>
    <p>When a stream variable gets closed, the actual instance of the
      otl_stream gets saved in the stream pool. Then if there is a
      request to a similar OTL stream, the OTL stream instance can be
      assigned to the otl_stream variable, which, may be, in its turn,
      either a local [in function] variable, or allocated on the heap. <a
        name="stream_pool_key"></a>The <i>similarity</i> of the streams
      is defined as <i>stream buffer size</i> + <i>SQL statement text</i>
      + <span style="font-style: italic;">overrides for SELECT output
        columns</span> (overridden via calls to otl_stream::<a
        href="otl3_stream_class.htm#set_column_type">set_column_type</a>()),



      meaning that streams with the same SQL statements, buffer sizes,
      and possibly SELECT output column overrides (in the case if the
      statement is a SELECT statement and some of its output columns
      were overridden) will be saved in the same bucket in the stream
      pool. </p>
    <p>Say, three instances of <i>similar</i> streams of
      &lt;buf_size1+SQLStm1+overrides&gt; were allocated and then all of
      them were closed. The pool will have one entry point for all the
      three and the actual bodies of the instances will be placed in the
      same bucket (see the diagram below). After that, the functions, in
      which the streams had been created, get called on the second
      iteration of a loop, and the corresponding otl_stream variables
      get instantiated again. The second time around, the instances of
      the similar streams, which were previously saved in the pool, will
      be pulled out of the pool and re-assigned to the variables, until
      the variables get closed again.</p>
    <p>In some cases, an instance of a stream, if it is, say, used only
      once, can bypass the pool and be destroyed without saving it in
      the pool. The otl_stream::<a href="otl3_stream_class.htm#close">close</a>()



      function has extended functionality to allow the developer to do
      that.</p>
    <p>If the stream pooling is undesirable, then the OTL code, which
      implements the pooling, can be turned off (not turned on at all).
      This is controlled by a conditional compilation <a
        href="otl3_compile.htm#OTL_STREAM_POOLING_ON">directive</a>,
      since OTL is a C++ template as well as macro library with a lot of
      conditional compilation directives in it, for efficient code
      generation.</p>
    <p>The stream pool has a fixed maximum size, that can be changed by
      the otl_connect::<a
        href="otl3_connect_class.htm#set_stream_pool_size">set_stream_pool_size</a>()
function.
And,
as



      it already should be obvious from the description above, the
      stream pool is a property of the <a href="otl3_connect_class.htm">otl_connect</a>
      object. </p>
    <p><a name="STREAM_POOLING_PREREQS"></a>Stream pooling can be
      enabled when #define <a href="otl3_compile.htm#OTL_STL">OTL_STL</a>
      (or #define <a href="otl3_compile.htm#OTL_ACE">OTL_ACE</a> if <a
        href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/%7Eschmidt/ACE.html">ACE</a> is
      used, or when #define <a href="otl3_compile.htm#OTL_UNICODE">OTL_UNICODE</a>
      / #define <a href="otl3_compile.htm#OTL_UNICODE_STRING_TYPE">OTL_UNICODE_STRING_TYPE</a>
      are used) is defined.<br>
      <br>
      When a new stream is being added to the stream pool but it doesn't
      have free slots, the <span style="font-style: italic;">least used</span>
      (as in LRU count based algorithms) entry gets freed up and used
      for the new stream. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The stream pooling has&nbsp; a relatively small overhead,
      compared to the use of otl_stream's, which are kept open always,
      and don't get closed. This is due to the fact that the
      std::map&lt;&gt;, as an STL&nbsp;data container, is efficient
      enough.</p>
