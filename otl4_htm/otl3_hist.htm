  <h1 align="center">History of the Project</h1>
  <p>This project started with my early experiments on the Oracle Call
Interface
back in 1994. Before that I had worked with C++ and several database
APIs
in different platforms. The idea was relatively obvious: SQL as a query
language is based on the concept of data sets. The process of
retrieving
data from and writing it to the database can be naturally expressed as
data streams. C++ had a concept of streams applied to files. </p>
  <p>It was a logical idea to combine the C++ streams and SQL as a
language with
data streams.. Besides the idea itself, a good implementation was
needed. It took me a while to realize that the simplest and most
efficient
implementation would be via C++ templates. </p>
  <p>I went through a few intermediate implementations that used
conventional
object oriented techniques like creating a class hierarchy with
inheritance
and making an object library out of the source code. Some folks might
have
used it. It is known as the Oracle SQL Class Library (OSCL). It was
released
in late 1995 / early 1996 time frame. At the time, I was working on H1B
visa as a technical consultant in a small "body shop" called
Mosakin Corp. That is why the OSCL was stored in Mosakin's Web site as
the "original product of the company." It seems that Mosakin
has changed its general direction of business and the OSCL is no longer
available in the Web site. </p>
  <p>The first real template version of the OTL (OTL 1.0) was made on
top
for the Oracle Call Interface 7.x for Oracle 7 and it was released in
late
1996 / early 1997. </p>
  <p>Around mid-1998 I received a lot of questions and requests from
different
folks who kept asking me about the OTL for the Oracle Call Interface 8.
The framework of the OTL 1.0 was enhanced a little bit and migrated to
the OCI8. It became the second version of the OTL (OTL 2.0). This is
the
version that was used by the developer community in 1998-2000. OTL 2.0
was available
for the OCI7 and OCI8 in separate header files.<br>
  </p>
  <p>In late 1998, I realized that the OTL framework could be migrated
to
the ODBC API. That is how the ODBC Template Library came along. </p>
  <p>Basically, all three OTL's (OTL/OCI7, OTL/OCI8 and OTL ODBC) were
similar
in the core but they were based on quite different API's. Each OTL was
around 150Kb of source code, so the combined code was around 500Kb. The
next logical step was to try to come up with a unified template stream
framework. I created the unified framework and also developed so called
OTL-adapters for the OCI7, OCI8 and ODBC. This more integrated version
of OTL became OTL 3.0.<br>
  </p>
  <p>The framework is truly template. The OTL-adapters are thin
wrappers
around the database APIs. The actual OTL classes are
instances
of the template classes instantiated from the framework and the
OTL-adapters.
The adapter classes are passed as parameters into the framework.<br>
  </p>
  <p>In 2001-2002 time frame, implementations of Unicode (both UTF-16
and UTF-8) were added to OTL. OTL 4.0 was released in 2001, as a
release that accumulated enough code modifications to go from version
3.x to 4.0. Around 2004,&nbsp; transition from 32-bit
platforms to 64-bit platforms has started and still goes on. The list
of supported database types grew substantially. <br>
  <br>
In 2008, I heard from many enough developers who worked on&nbsp; "OTL
legacy applications", and the developers asked me about backward
compatibility. Backward compatibility remains one of the main goals of
the OTL project, though occasionally it gets broken, and then fixed. As
long as C++ is used in database applications, I'll try to maintain the
OTL project, to keep the code base up to date, and hopefully I could
add more useful features.<br>
  <br>
Also, my hope is that at some point in the future, serious people from
the C++ standardization committee will look into the lack of a decent
C++ database access API, and come together to see what ideas are
available, and they might even consider the idea of combining the C++
stream idiom with SQL in some form. I'd be more than happy to
participate in such a project. <br>
